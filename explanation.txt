1. Setting up the page:
The code creates a web page using Streamlit, titled "Fake Review Detection System".
It asks users to upload a CSV file containing reviews.

2. Text cleaning function:
There's a function that cleans up the review text:
It makes all letters lowercase
Removes punctuation, numbers, and extra spaces

3. File upload:
Users can upload a CSV file through the web interface.

4. Processing the uploaded file:
If a file is uploaded, the code reads it.
It shows a preview of the data.

5. Checking the data:
The code checks if the CSV has the necessary 'text' column.
If there's also a 'label' column, it uses that for training. Otherwise, it uses a pre-made
model.

6. Training the model (if labels are provided):
If labels are present, it splits the data into training and testing sets.
It converts the text into numbers using TF-IDF (a way to represent text as numbers).
It trains a Logistic Regression model to classify reviews.
It then evaluates how well the model performs.

7. Using a pre-trained model (if no labels):
If there are no labels, it uses a simple pre-made model trained on a few example
reviews.

8. Classifying reviews:
Whether using a new model or the pre-made one, it then classifies all the reviews in the
uploaded file.

9. Showing results:
The code displays the classified reviews, separating them into "Real" and "Fake".
It shows how many reviews were classified as real or fake.
Users can download the classified reviews as CSV files.

10. Instructions:
At the end, it provides instructions on how to run this program on your own computer.
In essence, this code creates a web app where you can upload reviews, and it will try to
determine which ones are real and which ones are fake, either by learning from your data (if you
provide labels) or by using a simple pre-made model.

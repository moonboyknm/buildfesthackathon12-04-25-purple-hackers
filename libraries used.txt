what were the libraries used in this project
Based on the search results, several Python libraries were used in fake review detection
projects. Here's a comprehensive list of the libraries commonly used in these projects:

Core Libraries
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling CSV files and
dataframes [1] [2] .
NumPy: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with
mathematical functions to operate on these elements [1] .
scikit-learn: Offers various machine learning algorithms and tools for model training,
evaluation, and feature extraction including:
Feature extraction tools like TF-IDF vectorizer [3] [1]
Classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest [1] [2]
Model selection tools for train-test splitting [1] [2]

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A comprehensive library for NLP tasks including
tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and more [1] [4] [5] .
spaCy: A modern NLP library that provides advanced capabilities for text processing with
efficiency and speed [4] [6] .
Gensim: Used for topic modeling and identifying semantic similarity between documents
through vector space modeling [3] .

Text Preprocessing Tools
re (Regular Expressions): Used for text pattern matching and cleaning [7] [1] .
string: Provides common string operations useful in text preprocessing [7] [1] .

Visualization Libraries
Matplotlib.pyplot: Used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations [1] .
Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive
statistical graphics [1] .

Web Application Framework
Streamlit: Used for creating interactive web applications for the fake review detection
system, allowing users to upload CSV files and view results [7] .

Additional Libraries
Warnings: Used for handling warning messages during execution [1] .
nltk.corpus: Provides access to corpus readers for various corpora, including stopwords
which are commonly removed during text preprocessing [1] .
These libraries collectively enable the complete workflow of fake review detection, from data
loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment as an interactive
application. The most successful models for fake review detection appear to be Support Vector
Machines (with 88% accuracy) and Logistic Regression (with 86% accuracy) according to the
performance overview mentioned in the search results [1] .
